In this exercise, we completed the synthesis of one compound, and you will have a better idea of the considerations required for executing automated synthesis. Now imagine, we want to execute 100s - 1000s of different chemical reactions on a single session on the OpenTrons! Some design and smarter ways are needed as trying to track and code this will become a nightmare very quickly. In the next bit of this session, you will be shown how XChem is approaching this with CAR (Chemist Assisted Robotics) and all going well, a live demo on the robot.   \n",

    "# Generating 3D structures using ligand-based methods\n",
    "----\n",
    "<font size=\"3\">\n",
    "    \n",
    "So far, we have worked on 2D molecules (as SMILES), but if we want to better understand our candidates and select the most promising ones, we need to generate 3D conformations for those SMILES.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "There are many approaches for generating 3D conformations from the SMILES (e.g. constrained docking algorithms). In this notebook we will compute them using a ligand-based alignment and scoring routine. We assume that elaborations to the initial hit will not introduce massive changes to the binding mode, and that interactions seen in the initial hit protein-ligand complex will be conserved.\n",
    "    \n",
    "By default, 100 conformations of the new molecule will be calculated using the rdkit ETKDG conformation generation algorithm (Riniker & Landrum, 2015). These conformations will be then aligned to the reference hit molecule using Open3DAlign (O3A) (Tosco et al., 2011) also implemented in rdkit. In order to select which aligned conformation of the new molecule best fits with the reference molecule, we will use the SuCOS metric (Leung et al., 2019)). The SuCOS metric uses rdkit functions to calculate both the shape overlap and the chemical feature overlap between the elaborated molecule and the original fragment.\n",
    "    \n",
    "An implementation of this pipeline is shown in the next cell, where the main function is ``gen_conf_from_vector(input_mol_block, elaborated_smiles)`` where ``input_mol_block`` is the mol block from the reference structure, and ``elaborated_smiles`` is the smiles string of the molecule you want to calculate a predicted structure for.\n",
